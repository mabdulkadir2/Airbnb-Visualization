# Airbnb Data Viz
Tools used in this project were Excel and Tableau. 

In this project, I picked up some datasets on Kaggle, one of them being Airbnb rent, costs, bedrooms, the ID's registered when renting out, and more.
    What I first did was clean the data on excel such as removing any duplicates, blank spaces, fixing up rows/columns, and more
    I then transferred the data over to tableau and made joins with the 3 tables (Listings, Calenders, and Reviews) using an Inner Join.
    Following this, I made my visualizations from there starting with the "Price By Zipcode", "Average Price for Zip Code", "Revenue of the Airbnb's Per Month", 
    Number of Bedrooms Bringing in the Most Revenue", and ID's Registered With the Bedroom They're In."
    Lastly, made some final touch ups, then uploaded it to Tableau Public.
